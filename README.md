Usage
-----
The below are shown as called by an Activity

## Basic

```kotlin
ToolTipDialog(this, this)
  .title("This is a basic dialog") // Define the title for the tooltip
  .content("This dialog will show at the top of the screen by default") // Body content 
  .subtitle("Subtitle for tooltip") // Subtitle on the tooltip
  .setToolTipListener(toolTipListener) // Define the listener for clicks on the tooltip
  .show() // Build and show the tooltip
```

## Vertically positioned

Great for underlining an element or section of you UI.

```kotlin
ToolTipDialog(this, this)
  ...
  .setYPosition(720) // Align the top of the dialog with this position on screen
  .show()
```

## Point to specific location

You can also point to a specific point on screen. Great for calling out buttons and improving discoverability of buried features.

```kotlin
ToolTipDialog(this, this)
  ...
  .pointTo(250, 720) // Point to the specific X,Y position on-screen
  .show()
```

View the sample app for how to point to specific views.

## Peek-through views

Draw a typical shade behind your dialog but let specific views peek through.

```kotlin
ToolTipDialog(this, this)
  ...
  .addPeekThroughView(myCoolButton)
  .show()
```

You can also add as many of these as you'd like

```kotlin
ToolTipDialog(this, this)
  ...
  .addPeekThroughView(myCoolButton)
  .addPeekThroughView(myOtherButton)
  .addPeekThroughView(myAwesomeImage)
  .show()
```

FAQ

**My view keeps saying it's at `x:0, y:0`, making the dialog to point to the wrong spot**

You'll need to make sure that you let the system have time to inflate the layout or else the views won't have their proper sizes/dimenstions.

If you need to show the tooltip  on an early lifecycle event like `onCreate()` or `onViewCreated()`, yout can usually solve this issue by adding an additional delay or, more reliably, adding a ViewTreeObserver.

```kotlin
contentView.viewTreeObserver.addOnGlobalLayoutListener(object: ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener,
            ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalFocusChangeListener {
            override fun onGlobalLayout() {
                contentView.viewTreeObserver.removeOnGlobalFocusChangeListener(this)
                // Show Dialog here
            }
            
            ...
        })
```
